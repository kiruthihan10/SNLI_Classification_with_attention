# SNLI_Classification_with_attention
This project tackles the problem of snli dataset with attention mechanism

This project is all about comparing two sentences based on their meaning.
So I used an idea of vectorizing both sentences and find the aboslute distance between both of them as a data to predict the similarity.
This mechanism yields an accuracy of 71%.
We used dot attention mechanism as it would be more faster and get more accurate similarity value of the vectors.
